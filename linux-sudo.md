# sudo
The command `sudo` allows you to execute commands as the `root` user. The `root` user has privileges that a standard user does not, including access to files that standard users cannot view (like the `flag` files in the shell challenges). 

`sudo` requires a password in order to be used, so you will not be allowed to use it to complete challenges, but should be aware of its existence.
