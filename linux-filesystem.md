# File System

The file system in Linux is very similar to the one you are familiar with in Windows or in Mac. There is a hierarchy of folders and inside folders you can have files. We can also refer to folders as *directories*.

## Root Directory

The root directory is `/`. This directory is at the top of the hierarchy of directories.
