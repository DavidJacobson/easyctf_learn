# Linux

Linux is an Operating System (OS). An OS is a medium between the applications you use on your desktop and your physical machine and the hardware that is plugged into it. Other OS's that you may be familiar with may be Windows or Mac OS, or maybe a mobile one such as iOS or Android.

Linux comes in many distributions. Each distribution can be vastly different, but in EasyCTF we will be observing one of the more popular Linux distributions, Ubuntu. You can use our Ubuntu server in your browser or you can download your own copy for the full experience.
