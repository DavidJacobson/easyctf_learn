# EasyCTF Tutorials

Hey there! If you're new to hacking, this is definitely a great place to start!

## Hacking

Hacking is probably a little different from what you think it is. It's not about breaking into people's machines and stealing their passwords. It's about learning about systems and how they work, and most importantly, how to use this information to your advantage. According to PicoCTF 2013, here's what hacking's all about:

* Curiosity
* Learning through hands-on experimentation
* Striving to understand all parts of a system
* **Using this knowledge for good**

In other words, hackers are simply curious people. However, there are rules and legal stuff you have to worry about if you're a hacker, and that's the main reason why hackers have such a bad image today: irresponsible people breaking into systems they have no permission to be in and stealing information. PicoCTF 2013 outlines some important ethics when hacking:

* Don't poke at things you don't have permission to break
* Let someone know if you find their systems might be in jeopardy
* Be responsible, and use good judgement

If you're not careful, that's when you might find yourself in jail.

### tl;dr

Don't be stupid. Use common sense.
