# EasyCTF Tutorials

Hey there! If you're new to hacking, this is definitely a great place to start!

## CTF: What the heck is it?

Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are cybersecurity competitions. They are often held online in Jeopardy or Attack-Defense formats.

If you've ever played the physical capture-the-flag game, you'll know that flags are placed behind player defenses, and that players need to bypass those defenses to capture the flag. Similarly, in CTF security competitions, pieces of information, called flags, are placed behind various defenses, and participants must *hack* through the defenses to capture the flags.

CTFs may range from middle and high school level to collegiate or even professional. This book contains tutorials that can help you get started with CTFs.

### tl;dr

Don't be stupid. Use common sense.
