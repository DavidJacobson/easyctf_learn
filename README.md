# EasyCTF Tutorials

Hey there! If you're new to hacking, this is definitely a great place to start!

## Hacking

Hacking is probably a little different from what you think it is. It's not about breaking into people's machines and stealing their passwords. It's about learning about systems and how they work, and most importantly, how to use this information to your advantage.

In other words, hackers are simply curious people.
